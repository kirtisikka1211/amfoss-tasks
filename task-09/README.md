# **Kryptoscrapper**

*This was probably the toughest task I came across while doing the tasks .It took me soo much of time just to research and understand the basics of it.The scrapping part was easy,I was able to scrape the data .The hard part was to actually get it arranged in a csv file.As rust language was very new to me.It was hard.After working on it for 4-5 days ,I had to leave it as I was stuck,but somehow I gathered my courage and came back .Research and finally did it.*
