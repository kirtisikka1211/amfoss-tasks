# CineBot

*It was fun to do this task.Making a bot was never something I imagined myself doing in first sem of btech,It was really a fun experience ventrure in 
new topics in things I  thought  I knew.Although I took more time   than expected , me being a moviebuff,made me intrested in it more .It made me realise the value of one space or bracket.I did what we all do , googled everything.I first saw some youtube videos to get an idea on "what is a bot ?","How do you make a bot " As it was python .. It was not that hard to understand the code. I faced difficulties while slicing it correctly , which was due to some silly mistake I made.*
