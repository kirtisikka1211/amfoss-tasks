# Homebrew

As I was having mac there was no need of installing ubuntu , but I installed Homebrew.Got familier with terminal commands.As I was a windows user before, it took me some time to get familer with mac and learn all the commands.While installing homebrew , I faced some  issuses ..maybe because of the poor network, but after uninstalling , and  reinstalling
I was successfully  able to reinstall it.I was also able to install git via homebrew
