# **Flame game**

*I never imagined I  will make a game in my first sem .I dont play that many games .. so I used to think I am not interested in it.Well I am still not,but as I was introduced to flutter and dart programming ..or mobile development , I got really invested in it.This task was actually tough for me ...adding the buttons part was more complex than I thought.So I watched some videos on flutter ,the workshop also helped me understand the basics much better.*
