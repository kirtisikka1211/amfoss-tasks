## **About My Tasks**
The tasks were structured to cover many fields.Honestly,I found some of the tasks tough and some way easy.Though I was not able to complete all of them,but I got an exposure to different areas that I was not even aware of and found my hidden interest in programming.At the end ,I would just like to say it was a excellent opportunity to learn more.


## **Who am I?**
I am Kirti Sikka .I am from Noida,UP.I have represented Delhi  in National  aerobics championships .As I belonged  to a non cs-background(bio),I had no idea about Engineering .The irony of life! I somehow ended up enrolling in the same course and fortunately developed more interest in it. The best thing I like about coding is, I dont have to mug things up.The tasks actually made me more invested and curious about it.
