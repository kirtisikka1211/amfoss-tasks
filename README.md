## **About My Tasks**
The tasks were structured to cover many fields.Honestly,I found some of the tasks tough and some way easy.Though I was not able to complete all of them,but it was a emotional rollercoaster .First I was very excited to attempt the tasks, then eventually I got anxious,I could feel the pressure, the frustation of getting stuck by just a space or a comma was dreadful.I got an exposure to different areas that I was not even aware of,and found my hidden intrests in coding.At the end ,I would just like to say it was a good opportunity to learn more.


## **Who am I?**
I am Kirti Sikka .I am from Noida,UP.As I belonged  to a non cs-background(bio),I had no idea about engeneering and also I hated it.The irony of life!,I somehow ended up enrolling in the same course and fortunately developed more intrest in it. The best thing I like about coding is I dont have to mug things up.The tasks actually made me more invested and curious about it.
