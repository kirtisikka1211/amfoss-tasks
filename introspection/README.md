I have developed a zeal to learn in more depth and the thrill of getting an idea and implementing it to action is almost the best satisfaction anyone can experience.If I get a chance, I assure to work enthusiastically ,give the best in all the tasks assigned and also meeting the deadlines well in time.Amfoss tasks helped me to explore more areas .With my postive attitude and team spirt I surely will be a great asset to the club.


## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I look forward to becoming more efficient in programming language by scaling the heights in new fields.I am looking forward to working with you guys hopefully .I want to venture onto more  fields and then later on choose one I want to work in and to  be able to develop more stuff in it. I look forward to enhance my skill set both in the professional and personal space.In professional space I want to be more proficient in programming and development while in the personal space I want to learn collaboration ,team building skills and to learn from my exprienced seniors.



## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would contribute by adding my  learnings  and experiences in all spheres and  simultaneously learn and share more.As I am a fresher,I am not that much aware of the tasks but I am more than ready to push my limits and work hard. In a club like this I can contribute my team bulding skill set and positive attitude to the team.I am sure that I  will be able to justify my selection by contributing to the open source development projects.

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
The selection process which covers new and vast areas have actually helped me to know my potential in a far better way in terms of learning ,exploring and finding new things.As I used to belong to a non cs background , I have learnt many things just by attempting tasks.
