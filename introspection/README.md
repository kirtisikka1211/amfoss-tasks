# Introspection

## Why  must we  choose you?
You shoukd choose me because I am a quick learner and  I like working with another people.I have worked as a team in aerobics.
I have developed a zeal to learn in more depth and the thrill of getting an idea and impelementing it to action is almost the best satisfaction anyone can experience.If I get a chance, I assure to work enthusiastically and give the best in all the tasks assigned, meeting the deadlines well in time.Amfoss tasks helped me to explore more areas .I also feel like it will help me to discover more areas I am intrested in.Once I get invested in some task, I wouldnt be able to stop myself until it is completed.


## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I look forward to becoming more efficient in programming language by scaling the heights in new fields.I am looking forward to working with you guys hopefully .I want to venture onto more  fields and then later on choose one I wanna work in and to  be able to develop more stuff in it.Basically,building my skill set more .I look forward to enhance my skill set both in the proffesional and persnol space.In professional space I want to learn the algorithms.In persnol space I want to learn collaboration ,team building skills and to learn from my exprienced seniors.




## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would contribute by adding my  learnings  and experiences in all spheres and  simultaneously learn and share more.As I am a fresher,I am not that much aware of the tasks but I am more than ready to push my limits and work hard. As team club like this i can contribute my team bulding skil set and postivite attitude to the team.I am sure that I  will be able to justify my selection by contributing to the open source development projects.

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
The selection process which covers new and vast areas have actually helped me to know my potential in a far better way in terms of learning ,exploring and finding new things.As I used to belong to a non cs background , I have learnt many things just by attempting tasks.
