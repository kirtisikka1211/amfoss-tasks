# Introspection

## Why we must choose you?

Although I stepped in the world of Coding a few months back,I have developed a zeal to learn in more depth and the thrill of getting an idea and impelementing it to action is almost the best satisfaction  anyone can experience.If I get a chance ,I assure to work enthusiastically and give the best in all the tasks assigned ,meeting the deadlines well in time


## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I look forward to becoming more efficient in Coding by scaling the heights in new fields,
leading to excellence.



## How would you contribute back to the club?
I would contribute by adding my  learnings  and experiences in all spheres and simentaneously learn and share more.

## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
The selection process which covers new and vast areas have actually helped me to know my potential in a far better way in terms of learning ,exploring and finding new things.As I used to belong to a non cs background , I have learnt many things just by attempting tasks.
