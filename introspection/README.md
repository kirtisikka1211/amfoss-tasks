# Introspection

## Why we must choose you?

Although I stepped in the world of Coding a few months back,I have developed a zeal to learn in more depth and the thrill of getting an idea and impelementing it to action is almost the best thing anyone can experience.If I get a chance ,I assure to work enthusiastically and give the best in all the tasks assigned ,meeting the deadlines well in time


## What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I look forward to becoming more efficient in Coding by scaling the heights in new fields,
leading to excellence.



## How would you contribute back to the club?
I will 


## Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
The selection process contains tasks covering a large area.I was introduced to more new topics and have become a tad better in googling and coding also.
As I used to belong to a non cs background , I have learnt many things just by attempting tasks.
